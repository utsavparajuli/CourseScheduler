# CourseScheduler
 
This program will emulate a Course Registration System. The data of students, courses, faculties will be taken in from a list of input files. 
The courses students wish to take and the courses faculties wish to teach will also be take in from an input file.

Then those data will be parsed and contained in the course directory and person directory. Then the scheduling algorithm will be called and it will schedule students
and faculties to the courses.

After scheduling we are left with sorting the refining the courses as some courses will not have enough students to be taught. 

After refining and deleting courses and sessions that did not meet the requirement the data will be outputted to different output files.
